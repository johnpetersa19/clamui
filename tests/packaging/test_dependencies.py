# ClamUI Dependency Consistency Tests
"""
Tests for dependency consistency across packaging formats.

Tests cover:
- Debian control vs pyproject.toml alignment
- Minimum version constraints
- Flatpak pinned versions sync
- GIR (GTK/Adw) dependencies

These tests prevent dependency drift between packaging formats.
