# ClamUI Input Sanitization Module
"""
Input sanitization functions for log entries to prevent log injection attacks.

This module provides functions to sanitize user-controlled input (file paths,
threat names, ClamAV output) before storing in log entries. It protects against:
- Control characters that could manipulate terminal output
- ANSI escape sequences that could hide or modify displayed content
- Unicode bidirectional overrides that could obscure malicious filenames
- Null bytes that could truncate or confuse log parsing
- Newline injection in single-line fields that could forge log entries
