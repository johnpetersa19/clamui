## Getting Started

### Launching ClamUI

After installing ClamUI using your preferred method, you can launch it in several ways:

**From your Application Menu:**
- Look for "ClamUI" in your desktop's application launcher
- On GNOME, press the Super key and type "ClamUI"
- The application appears with a shield icon

**From the Terminal:**

If you installed via Flatpak:
```bash
flatpak run com.github.rooki.ClamUI
```

If you installed via .deb package or from source:
```bash
clamui
```

**With Files to Scan:**

You can also launch ClamUI with files or folders to scan immediately:

```bash
# Flatpak
flatpak run com.github.rooki.ClamUI /path/to/file /path/to/folder

# Native installation
clamui /path/to/file /path/to/folder
```

When launched with file arguments, ClamUI will open with those paths pre-loaded in the scan view.

### First-Time Setup

When you first launch ClamUI, the application will:

1. **Check for ClamAV Installation**
   - ClamUI requires ClamAV (the antivirus engine) to be installed on your system
   - If ClamAV is not found, you'll see a warning message with installation instructions
   - See the [Troubleshooting](#clamav-not-found) section if you encounter this issue

2. **Create Default Scan Profiles**
   - ClamUI automatically creates three useful scan profiles:
     - **Quick Scan**: Scans common locations like Downloads, Desktop, and Documents
     - **Full Scan**: Comprehensive scan of your entire home directory
     - **Home Folder**: Scans your home directory with common exclusions
   - You can customize these or create your own profiles later

3. **Set Up Configuration Directories**
   - Settings are saved to `~/.config/clamui/`
   - Scan logs and quarantine data are stored in `~/.local/share/clamui/`
   - These directories are created automatically

**Updating Virus Definitions**

Before your first scan, it's important to ensure your virus definitions are up to date:

1. Click the **Update Database** button (cloud icon with arrow) in the header bar
2. Click the "Update Now" button in the Update view
3. Wait for the update to complete (this may take a few minutes on first run)
4. You'll see a success message when definitions are current

💡 **Tip**: ClamUI can check for database updates automatically. See [Database Update Settings](#database-update-settings) to enable auto-updates.

### Understanding the Main Window

ClamUI uses a clean, modern interface that follows GNOME design guidelines. Here's what you'll see when you open the application:

![Main Window](../screenshots/main_view.png)

**Header Bar (Top)**

The header bar contains your main navigation and controls:

- **ClamUI Title**: Shows the application name
- **Navigation Buttons** (left side): Six icon buttons to switch between views:
  - 📁 **Scan Files**: Main scanning interface (default view)
  - ☁️ **Update Database**: Update virus definitions
  - 📄 **View Logs**: Browse scan history
  - ⚙️ **ClamAV Components**: Check ClamAV installation status
  - 🛡️ **Quarantine**: Manage isolated threats
  - 📊 **Statistics**: View protection statistics and scan activity
- **Menu Button** (right side): Access Preferences, About, and Quit

**Content Area (Center)**

The main content area displays the currently selected view. Each view has its own purpose:

- **Scan View**: Select files/folders to scan, configure scan options, and view results
- **Update View**: Check database status and update virus definitions
- **Logs View**: Review past scan results and filter by date/status
- **Components View**: Verify ClamAV installation and component versions
- **Quarantine View**: Manage files that have been isolated due to threats
- **Statistics View**: See charts and metrics about your scanning activity

**Status Information**

At the bottom of most views, you'll find:
- ClamAV version information
- Database status (last updated date and number of signatures)
- Quick status indicators

### Navigating Between Views

Switching between different parts of ClamUI is simple and intuitive.

**Using the Navigation Buttons**

The six buttons in the header bar let you quickly jump to any view:

1. Click any navigation button to switch to that view
2. The active view's button will be highlighted (pressed in)
3. The content area updates immediately to show the selected view

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

ClamUI supports keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit ClamUI |
| `Ctrl+,` | Open Preferences |

💡 **Tip**: More keyboard shortcuts for specific actions are available in each view.

**View-Specific Navigation**

Some views have additional navigation within them:

- **Scan View**: Switch between "Quick Actions" using scan profiles
- **Logs View**: Filter and search through scan history
- **Statistics View**: Change timeframe filters (7 days, 30 days, all time)

**Returning to the Scan View**

Click the folder icon (📁) button in the header bar at any time to return to the main scanning interface.

### Your First Scan

Ready to scan for viruses? This walkthrough will guide you through running your very first scan with ClamUI. We'll show you how to select what to scan, understand what's happening during the scan, and interpret the results.

#### Selecting Files and Folders

ClamUI gives you several ways to choose what to scan. Pick the method that works best for you:

**Method 1: Using the Browse Button**

This is the most straightforward approach:

1. Look for the **Scan Target** section in the main view
2. Click the **Browse** button on the right side of the "Selected Path" row
3. A file picker dialog will appear
4. Navigate to the folder or file you want to scan
5. Click **Select** to confirm your choice
6. The selected path will appear in the "Selected Path" subtitle

💡 **What should I scan first?** Start with your Downloads folder - it's where files from the internet arrive and is most likely to contain threats.

**Method 2: Drag and Drop**

For quick scanning, you can simply drag files or folders into ClamUI:

1. Open your file manager (Files, Nautilus, etc.)
2. Locate the file or folder you want to scan
3. Drag it into the ClamUI window
4. Drop it anywhere in the scan view
5. The path will be automatically selected

**Visual Feedback**: When dragging over ClamUI, you'll see a highlighted border indicating it's ready to accept your files.

**Method 3: Using Scan Profiles** (Recommended for beginners)

Scan profiles are pre-configured scan targets that make scanning even easier:

1. Look for the **Scan Profile** section at the top
2. Click the dropdown menu (it says "No Profile (Manual)" by default)
3. Choose one of the default profiles:
   - **Quick Scan**: Scans common locations (Downloads, Desktop, Documents)
   - **Full Scan**: Comprehensive scan of your entire home directory
   - **Home Folder**: Scans your home directory with common exclusions
4. The scan target will be automatically set when you select a profile

💡 **Tip**: For your first scan, try "Quick Scan" - it's fast and covers the most important areas.

**Method 4: Command-Line Arguments** (Advanced)

If you're comfortable with the terminal, you can launch ClamUI with a path already selected:

```bash
# Flatpak
flatpak run com.github.rooki.ClamUI ~/Downloads

# Native installation
clamui ~/Downloads
```

This method is great for integrating ClamUI with other tools or file managers.

#### Understanding Scan Progress

Once you've selected what to scan, you're ready to start. Here's what to expect:

**Starting the Scan**

1. Click the **Scan** button (the big blue button in the middle)
2. You'll immediately see changes in the interface:
   - The Scan button becomes disabled (grayed out)
   - The Browse button and Profile dropdown are also disabled
   - A "Scanning..." message appears at the bottom
   - The entire interface becomes non-interactive to prevent conflicts

**During the Scan**

While ClamUI is scanning:

- **Be patient**: Scanning can take time, especially for large folders or if you have many files
- **Don't close the window**: Closing ClamUI will stop the scan in progress
- **Watch the status**: The status message at the bottom will show "Scanning..." until complete
- **System usage**: You may notice increased CPU usage - this is normal as ClamAV analyzes files

**How long will it take?**

Scan duration depends on:
- **Number of files**: More files = longer scan time
- **File sizes**: Large files take longer to analyze
- **Scan backend**: Daemon (clamd) is faster than standalone clamscan
- **System resources**: Faster CPU = faster scanning

Typical scan times:
- Downloads folder (100-500 files): 10-30 seconds
- Home directory (10,000+ files): 2-10 minutes
- Full system scan: 15-60+ minutes

💡 **Tip**: While your first scan runs, feel free to read ahead in this guide to learn about other features!

**Scan Completion**

When the scan finishes:
- All buttons become active again
- The status message updates with results
- If threats were found, they appear in the "Scan Results" section below
- If no threats were found, you'll see a success message

#### Interpreting Scan Results

After your scan completes, ClamUI displays clear, easy-to-understand results. Let's break down what you'll see:

![Scan Results Example](../screenshots/main_view_with_scan_result.png)

**Clean Scan (No Threats Found)**

If your files are clean, you'll see:

```
✓ Scan complete: No threats found (XXX files scanned)
```

This green success message means:
- All scanned files are safe
- No viruses, trojans, or malware were detected
- You can continue using your files normally

The number in parentheses shows how many files were examined.

**Threats Detected**

If ClamUI finds threats, you'll see:

```
⚠ Scan complete: X threat(s) found
```

This red warning message is followed by a detailed list of each threat found. Don't panic - ClamUI gives you all the information and tools you need to handle threats safely.

**Understanding Threat Details**

Each detected threat is displayed in a card showing:

1. **Threat Name** (large text at the top)
   - The technical name of the virus or malware
   - Example: "Eicar-Signature", "Win.Test.EICAR_HDB-1"
   - This name is used by antivirus databases worldwide

2. **Severity Badge** (colored label on the right)
   - **CRITICAL** (red): Dangerous malware, immediate action required
   - **HIGH** (orange): Serious threats, should be quarantined
   - **MEDIUM** (yellow): Moderate concern, investigate further
   - **LOW** (blue): Minor issues or test files

3. **File Path** (monospaced text, second line)
   - The exact location of the infected file
   - You can select and copy this text
   - Example: `/home/username/Downloads/suspicious_file.exe`

4. **Category** (if available)
   - The type of threat detected
   - Examples: "Trojan", "Test", "Malware", "PUA" (Potentially Unwanted Application)

5. **Action Buttons** (bottom of each card)
   - **Quarantine**: Safely isolates the threat file
   - **Copy Path**: Copies the file path to your clipboard

**What Should I Do With Detected Threats?**

Here's your action plan:

1. **Don't panic** - ClamUI has already identified the threat and prevented any harm
2. **Review the threat details** - Check the file path to understand what was flagged
3. **Click "Quarantine"** - This safely moves the file to isolation where it can't cause harm
4. **Verify it's not a false positive** - Sometimes legitimate files are mistakenly flagged (see FAQ)

**For most users**: Click "Quarantine" on any detected threats. You can always restore files later if needed.

**Testing With EICAR**

Not sure if ClamUI is working correctly? Use the built-in test feature:

1. Click the **Test (EICAR)** button next to the Scan button
2. ClamUI creates a harmless test file that all antivirus software recognizes
3. The scan runs automatically and should find the test "threat"
4. You'll see a detection for "Eicar-Signature" or similar
5. This confirms ClamUI is working properly

**Important**: EICAR is NOT real malware - it's an industry-standard test pattern that's completely safe. It exists only to test antivirus software.

**Understanding Large Result Sets**

If a scan finds many threats (50+), ClamUI uses smart pagination:

- Only the first 25 threats are shown initially
- A **"Show More"** button appears at the bottom
- Click it to load 25 more threats at a time
- This keeps the interface responsive even with hundreds of detections

**Next Steps After Your First Scan**

Congratulations on completing your first scan! Now you can:

- **Explore scan profiles** - Try the Quick Scan, Full Scan, or Home Folder profiles
- **Set up scheduled scans** - Automate scanning to run regularly
- **Check the quarantine** - Review what's been isolated
- **View scan history** - See all your past scans in the Logs view
- **Customize settings** - Configure ClamUI to match your preferences
