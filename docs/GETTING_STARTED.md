## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

The recommended installation method depends on your distribution:

| Distribution | Recommended Method |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Any distribution** | [Flatpak](#flatpak-installation) (universal) |
| Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint | [.deb package](#debian-package-installation) |
| Fedora, Arch, others | [Flatpak](#flatpak-installation) |

#### Flatpak Installation

Flatpak works on any Linux distribution and includes automatic updates.

**1. Install Flatpak (if needed):**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install flatpak

# Fedora (pre-installed)
# Fedora includes Flatpak by default

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S flatpak
```

**2. Add Flathub repository:**
```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

**3. Install ClamUI:**
```bash
flatpak install flathub io.github.linx_systems.ClamUI
```

> **Note:** The Flatpak version bundles ClamAV internally — no separate ClamAV installation is required.

**4. Launch ClamUI:**
```bash
flatpak run io.github.linx_systems.ClamUI
```
Or find "ClamUI" in your application menu.

---

### Alternative Methods

#### Debian Package Installation

For Debian, Ubuntu, and derivative distributions:

**1. Install dependencies:**
```bash
# GTK4, Adwaita, and Python bindings
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1

# ClamAV antivirus
sudo apt install clamav
```

**2. Download and install the .deb package:**
Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/linx-systems/clamui/releases), then:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i clamui_*.deb
sudo apt install -f  # Fix any missing dependencies
```

#### Running from Source

For development or the latest changes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linx-systems/clamui.git
cd clamui

# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 clamav

# Install Python dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run ClamUI
uv run clamui
```

---

### Verification

After installation, verify ClamUI is working correctly:

```bash
# For native installation
which clamui
clamui --version

# For Flatpak
flatpak info io.github.linx_systems.ClamUI
```

Check ClamAV is installed:
```bash
clamscan --version
freshclam --version
```

---

## Your First Use

### Launching the App

After installation, launch ClamUI in one of these ways:

1. **From your Application Menu:** Search for "ClamUI" in your desktop's application launcher
2. **From the Terminal:**
   ```bash
   # Flatpak
   flatpak run io.github.linx_systems.ClamUI

   # Native installation
   clamui
   ```

When you first launch, ClamUI will:
- Check for ClamAV installation
- Create default scan profiles (Quick Scan, Full Scan, Home Folder)

### Understanding the Interface

ClamUI has 6 main views, accessible via the sidebar:

| View | Icon | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Scan** | `document-open` | File/folder scanning interface |
| **Updates** | `system-software-update` | Virus database updates |
| **Logs** | `document-history` | Past scan history |
| **Quarantine** | `security-medium-symbolic` | Manage quarantined files |
| **Statistics** | `chart-symbolic` | Scan statistics dashboard |
| **Preferences** | `preferences-system-symbolic` | Application settings |

### Your First Scan

1. **Click the Scan view** (first icon in the sidebar)
2. **Click "Select Files or Folders"** or drag files onto the window
3. **Click "Scan"** to begin

> **Tip:** You can also right-click files in your file manager and select "Scan with ClamUI" (requires context menu setup).

### Understanding Results

After a scan completes, you'll see:

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Clean** | Green | No threats detected |
| **Infected** | Red | Threats found - see Quarantine |
| **Error** | Orange | Scan failed (see details) |

**If threats are found:**
- Click "View Details" to see infected files
- Click "Quarantine" to isolate threats
- Click "Restore" to return files from quarantine
